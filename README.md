Write the Missing Number Game Program. You will write a program that will allow a user to play the missing number game. The game will display a 4 (rows) x 3 (columns) board of numbers that will be predetermined (board 1 is shown below). The missing number is based on the other numbers displayed on the board; this is based on the sum of the two outer column numbers equaling the center.Allow the user to guess three times, after the user has guess three times, indicate they have lost the game and give them the opportunity to play again ( do not allow the same board to be displayed again if they guess the answer correctly). If they have played all three boards successfully, output a message they are the number guessing champion and exit the program.
